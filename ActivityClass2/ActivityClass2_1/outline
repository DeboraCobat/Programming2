## ICA-2-1

(Rectangle Class)

Design a UML Class Diagram for the Rectangle class.
Create a class Rectangle with attributes length and width, each of which defaults to 1.0.
Provide methods that calculate the rectangleâ€™s perimeter and area. It has set and get
methods for both length and width. The set methods should verify that length and width are each
floating-point numbers larger than 0.0 and less than 20.0. Write a program to test class Rectangle.

## ICA-2-2

(Savings Account Class)
Design a UML Class Diagram for the Savings Account class.
Create class SavingsAccount.
Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate for all account holders.
Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit.

Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the
savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12â€”this interest should be added to savings-
Balance. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new
value.
Write a program to test class SavingsAccount (SavingsAccountTest.java).
Instantiate two savingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively.
Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest for each of 12 months and
print the new balances for both savers. Next, set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for both savers.
