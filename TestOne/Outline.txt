Java II Test V2
===============
Take the time to read all the questions, then choose one question to develop.

For any question, you may create a tester class to test your design. Consider using exceptions if needed.


Question 5
==========
Write a family tree program. Create a class to represent a person (Person.java) and to store references to the 
personâ€™s mother, father, and any children the person has. 

Read a file of names to initialize the name and parentâ€“child relationships of each Person. (You might wish to 
create a file representing your own family tree.) 

Store the overall list of Persons as an ArrayList. Write an overall main user interface that asks for a name 
and prints the maternal and paternal family line for that person.

Hereâ€™s a hypothetical execution of the program, using as an input file the line of English Tudor monarchs:

Person's name? Henry VIII
Maternal line:
Henry VIII
Elizabeth of York
Paternal line:
Henry VIII
Henry VII
Children:
Mary I
Elizabeth I
Edward VI
